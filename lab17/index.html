<h1>Lab 17 - Advanced jQuery</h1>
 <p>For this lab we experimented with more advanced jQuery libraries on our
	 site. Using jQuery, we created buttons and added clicks to them. We were
	 able to figure this out because it was essentially just what we went over
	 in class on Wednesday.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
 <p>We ran into issues when trying to toggle elements on the webpage.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here you can see our buttons:</p>
<button class="challenge-button">
  Challenges!
</button>
<button class="result-button">
  Results!
</button>
<div id="new">
  new div element
</div>
