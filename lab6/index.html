	<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
	<p>For this lab, we had to experiment with Javascript data types and variables.
		In this lab, we once again used Javascript console in Chrome to experiment with objects and arrays.
		We created an array of different types of transportation we use, then created an object for our main method of transportation.
		We did all this using the Javascript console, then brought it into Atom and turned it into code. Once we completed everything,
		we made a simple HTML page, detailing everything from the lab.
 </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>This lab was very similar to lab 5, so there weren't as many challenges,
		but it was sometmes difficult to make sure I was perfectly following
		javascript notation. We weren't able to get the linked javascript to show up on this webpage.</p>
