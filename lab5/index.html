	<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
	<p>For this lab, we had to experiment with Javascript data types and variables.
 	 We first created variables for our primary mode of transportation using the
 	 Javascript console in Chrome and then brought it into Atom and turned it into
 	 code. Once we completed everything, we made a simple HTML page, detailing
 	 everything from the lab. </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>For this lab, it was challenging to be sure if I was following
		the proper javascript coding conventions.</p>
