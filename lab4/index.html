<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
In this lab, we used JavaScript for the first time by pseudocoding.
We first had to break down, or pseudocode, all of the steps that go into an everyday task.
We then had to pseudocode a computer task. Once we had all of the steps written out, we brought it into a text editor,
saved it as a JavaScript file and turned it into JavaScript comments using //.
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>For this lab, it was challenging to think of a topic
to base our psuedocode on.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>

      // Print each item or print space if slot is empty
      // Print a | between
    // Print a newline at the end
